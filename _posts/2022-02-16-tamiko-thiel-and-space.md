## Tamiko Thiel Discussion

One of the aspects of Tamiko Thielâ€™s works that I really appreciated was using the human body and perception as a tool in designing their experiences (like with the japanese internment camp, seeing the entire thing in your peripheral vision gives you the feel of being there walking around). In this installation, the contribution of space to understanding or connecting to the art was very deliberate, in coupling the physical feeling of being trapped with these articles of other cultural groups facing similar situations. I think asking this question of how can a VR/AR experience actually contribute in a meaningful way to storytelling is one to keep in mind when designing our own projects. 

The second thing I noticed was that Tamiko was really thoughtful about placing these museum experiences within their political/social/historical contexts, for example with the Berlin Wall Exhibit.The bit about guards coming up to you whenever you get closer to the wall really has the effect of making you feel the emotional and human connection to the piece in the museum. I think this practice of finding ways to effectively get the visitor of an installation to understand what it means to fully experience the emotional weight of an object is one to keep in mind as well.
