This quote from Sumaya Kassim stood out to me as a particularly important aspect of the article: “whether large British institutions like BMAG can and should promote “decolonial” thinking, or whether, in fact, they are so embedded in the history and power structures that decoloniality challenges, that they will only end up co-opting decoloniality”.

I think this question is important and a central theme in the article. If an effort towards decolonizing museums is going to be made, it is important that the effort itself is looked at from a critical lens. Who is supporting this effort, and how? What could be their motivation in decolonizing museums, and will they make an honest and well-thought out effort to do so? Will they listen to feedback from BAME individuals when they inevitably make mistakes in identifying the scope or extent of these problems in museums? If the answers to these questions are unclear or unsatisfying, then these museum organizations run the risk of making decolonization a digestible buzzword that is merely virtue signaling in the way that other white institutions across the world have used the word “diversity” for such benefits.
