How are you all transporting the rotating gears structure? Are you thinking at all about how that affects the integrity of that particular exhibit?

How do you choose collections?

How are you planning to use the extra space in the new museum? Are there unique kinds of spaces you're considering adding? Any lecture halls?

How are you thinking about representing current and past MIT communities within the museum? 

How will you measure the "success" of the new museum? 

What are the parameters/restrictions/limiting factors that you have to operate under when creating or designing the museum.
