I chose to review the [Museo Del Violino]( https://www.museodelviolino.org/en/) in Cremona, Italy.  Some things I think the museum does well are:

-Fairly active social media presence. Posting a couple of times a month. Mostly advertising events going on but still better than nothing. I think they could have more engagement in terms of showing off their exhibits.They have diversity in their platforming, (on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram).

-The live events are really cool. Beautiful concert space which is often used by musicians who play the instruments from the museum. During Covid it looks like they tried to keep up live streams of concerts in the space, which I think is a good way of keeping public interest in attending the museum.

-As far as resources that are helpful outside of visiting the museum, they offer some history of the area surrounding the museum and descriptions of some of the exhibits. I liked their incorporation of the google arts and culture resource, where there’s actually a link for each individual instrument currently on exhibition. Under this link, you can view the instrument in 3D (similar to google maps street view, as if you were actually there), read about the maker of the instrument and the stylistic influences of it, and actually watch a performance with the instrument in use. I think this is a really solid effort at bringing these instruments to the public who might not be able to get to the museum for whatever reason. 


Communities they engage:
-It looks like they partner with students, having concerts with the instruments of the museum.
-Partnership in research with politecnico di milano, violin making topics and acoustics
-Part of “friends of Stradivari”, an "international network bringing together people who possess, use or keep in custody instruments of the Cremonese classical violin making tradition, as well as people who study them, love them or just want to support the promotion and development of the violin making tradition from a cultural standpoint". According to the website, the goal of this organization is "to create a virtual community, and to bring to Cremona instruments to display, study and listen, because all these instruments belong to the entire world".

Overall though,I think the website could be better designed. It’s not super pleasing to the eye, and I think it takes some digging to find all of this information. I don’t think it’s something you would come across unless you were looking for it, so I think they could be more creative in finding ways to engage new audiences.
